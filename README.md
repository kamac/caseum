CASEUM LANGUAGE
======

About
------
Caseum is a quite basic language. It's original reason for development was to simply learn how to code a lexer, parser & some simple code generator from scratch. Development started in december, 2013 by kamac.

If you want, you can have a peek at how does the language syntax look like. Just browse the examples/ folder.
